      <h4>Richard Watson Gilder (1844-1909)</h4>
      <p>Richard Watson Gilder was a poet and editor of the Century magazine. &#x41d;e
         worked as a reporter for the <span class="i">Newark Daily Advertiser</span> and
         the <span class="i">Newark Morning Register</span> before becoming editor of
         the magazine <span class="i">Hours At Home</span> in 1869. When the latter was
         merged with the newly-founded <span class="i">Scribner's Monthly</span> the
         following year, Gilder was made assistant editor under Josiah Gilbert Holland.
         &#x41d;&#x435; succeeded Holland as editor-in-chief in 1881 and turned the publication,
         renamed <span class="i">The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</span>, into
         the most renowned and influential general interest magazine in the United States
         ("Overview," <span class="i">Richard Watson Gilder papers, 1855-1916</span>

      <h4>Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906)</h4>
      <p>Paul Laurence Dunbar was one of the first important black poets in
         American literature and the first black American to achieve an international
         audience for his work. Best known for his poems in dialect, Dunbar became a
         sought-after writer at the turn of the century, popular with black and white
         audiences alike, and his work was featured in many newspapers and magazines.
         Critics received this work very well. The editor of <span class="i">Harper's
            Weekly</span> gave the book an excellent review. A New York publishing company
         contracted with Dunbar to publish his two earlier collections as a single volume
         called <span class="i">Lyrics of a Lowly Life</span>. It became an instant
         success ("Paul L. Dunbar," <span class="i">Ohio History Central</span>, Ohio
         History Connection, 2020,
         https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Paul_L._Dunbar).

         The Century
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Century Magazine</span> was an American magazine
         published by The Century Company that replaced <span class="i">Scribner's
            Monthly Magazine</span> in 1881. The magazine published illustrated articles
         on history, science, and literature, sometimes publishing fiction as well. In
         1930, it merged with <span class="i">The Forum</span>.

         The March of Progress
         
      </h4>
      <p>The short story "March of Progress" was published in <span class="i">The Century</span> in 1901, and it features a dramaticization of the problem
         facing a black schoolboard in Patesville, North Carolina in the 1880s (William
         L. Andrews, <span class="i">The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt</span>,
         Louisiana State University Press, 1999: 82).

      <a id="tho"></a><h4>
         The Haunted Oak
         
      </h4>
      <p>"The Haunted Oak," written and published in December 1900, in the <span class="i">Century</span> was inspired in Washington, D.C., by a story that
         Dunbar heard an old black man telling of his nephew in Alabama who was hanged
         from an oak tree after having been falsely accused of "a grave crime." According
         to the story, shortly afterwards the leaves on the limb, used for the lynching,
         yellowed and fell off; and, unlike the rest of the normal tree, the offending
         bough shriveled and died. Townspeople began to call the tree "the haunted oak."
         Dunbar, using the ballad form to enhance the superstition, personifies the tree
         and makes it the most sensitive and remorseful participant in the crime (James
         A. Emanuel, "Racial Fire in the Poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar," <span class="i">A Singer in the Dawn: Reinterpretations of Paul Laurence
            Dunbar</span>, ed. Jay Martin, Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 1975: 81).
