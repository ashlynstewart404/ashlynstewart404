        <br/>
        <p> I am a third-year doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying nineteenth-century American literature and digital humanities.  My research interests center on national periodicals from the mid-nineteenth century, particularly Harper publications.  I also work on two digital archives: the Walt Whitman Archive and the Charles W. Chesnutt Archive.  I hold a BA in English and History from the University of Denver and an MA in English from UNL. </p>

       <p>As an Assistant Editor at the Walt Whitman Archive and Charles W. Chesnutt Archive, I have contributed to several NEH- and NHPRC-funded projects. Informed by digital scholarly editing theory, I encode a wide variety of texts to be available for open access on the web.</p>

       <p>I have published my own research on <em>Harperâ€™s Weekly</em>, a collaborative research guide for nineteenth-century American magazines, and two (forthcoming) collaborative book chapters about Walt Whitman about his views of his personal archive and his punctuation, respectively.
