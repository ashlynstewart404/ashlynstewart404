        <br/>
        <p>Charles Waddell Chesnutt, an African American man of letters, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on 20 June 1858, the son of free African Americans who had emigrated from Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1872 financial necessity forced him to begin a teaching career in Charlotte, North Carolina. He returned to Fayetteville in 1877, married a year later, and by 1880 had become principal of the Fayetteville State Normal School for Negroes. Meanwhile, he continued to pursue private studies of the English classics, foreign languages, music, and stenography. Despite his successes, he longed for broader opportunities and a chance to develop the literary skills that by 1880 led him toward an author's life. In 1883 he moved his family to Cleveland, and he resided in Cleveland for the remainder of his life, until November 15, 1932.</p> 

<p>As a writer, he chronicled the intimate and complex web of familial, social, and economic relationships that zigzag across America’s color line. He worked deftly across genres and published more than sixty short stories in the black and white press between 1885 and 1905. His stories appeared through syndication in newspapers across the country and in the nation’s elite magazines, and his novels were published by the nation’s most prestigious houses. He was also a public speaker and essayist, and he sustained friendships and correspondence with W. E. B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, Kelly Miller, and others.</p> 

<p>For this project, The Chesnutt-Publisher Correspondence project, we, the editors, hope to highlight the blending intersections of business and friendship. The letters collected here between Chesnutt and his publishers display the familiarity threaded through the publication process. While Chesnutt was looking for publication, he was also developing and maintaining networks with magazine editors and proprietors. From sending birthday cards to arranging visits between children, Chesnutt cultivated relationships with these literary men to obviously gain publication, but also to engage with the literary sphere in a more effective way. He had become a confident and friend, as is shown in most of these letters, as well as a supporter of the Negro History Journal and the editions of Horace Traubel. These letters also show that the man was not a flawless mode of communication, as several letters detail the struggles with receiving texts or payments for texts and/or subscriptions.</p>
